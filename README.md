 After her speech, you can see a window where you can select an egg and start the game starts.<br>
 The pet has three levels of growing, one as an egg, second as a baby and last as an adult.<br>
 At the game the pet can eat, sleep, take a bath, play with you and you can also teach it how to speak.<br>
 The pet has 5 needs : being petted, eat, sleep, take a bath and play. If all needs go down the game is over.<br>
