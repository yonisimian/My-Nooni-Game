 After her speech, you can see a window where you can select an egg and starts the game.<br>
 The pet has three levels of growing, one as an egg, second as a baby and last as an adult.<br>
 The pet can eat, sleep, take a bath, play with you and you can also teach it how to speak.<br>
 The pet has 5 needs : being petted, eat, sleep, take a bath and play. If all needs go down the game is over.<br><br>
 The game is very easy to understand and each level starts with a speech box with Pam giving an explanation on the level.<br><br>
